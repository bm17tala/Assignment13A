This was an assignment from my C# Programming course at HVCC I completed in the Spring of 2023. 
This assignment had me practicing Object-Oriented features such as method overloading and inheritance within C#. 
These projects went along with my 'Assignment13A_DLL' repository, which contains the source code for the dll files that
contain the objects used in this repository's code.
